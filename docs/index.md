# Motivation
You can't fix what you can't see.

Whether you're monitoring forest health, quantifying urban growth, tracking shipping patterns, assessing disaster damage, or modeling fire risk, your data science toolkit probably includes some indexing on both space and time.

**[Planet](https://www.planet.com)** launched almost a decade ago and continues to operate with this ambitious mission:
> to image the whole world every day making change visible, accessible, and actionable.

In our current state of sheltering-in-place during the COVID-19 pandemic, we can still observe and analyze our ever-changing world thanks to sensors in space!
