This workshop will introduce platforms for exploring Planet's archive of Earth observation data, which contains petabytes of imagery. Since the 2020 Big Earth Hacks event is a wildland fire challenge, the examples and demos will focus on fire-related data stories. You need not limit yourself to looking at imagery of active fires, though! 

Think about how biogeochemical systems and human society inter-relate:

- what kinds of structural changes can contribute to fire risk?
- where are the bottlenecks in modern wildfire alerting systems?
- how can we measure long-term effects of fires on communities and ecosystems?

## Agenda
- introduce Planet tools and resources
- walk through imagery download workflows
- visualize and analyze Planet imagery in Google Earth Engine
- demonstrate GIS integrations
- Q&A
