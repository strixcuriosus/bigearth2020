Now that you've had a tour of Planet's platform and data alongside analysis techniques in Google Earth Engine, think about what you can do with daily Earth imagery! 

## Can you improve fire risk maps?
Google Earth Engine supports several image classification models. Can land classifcation modeling on top of daily imagery improve our prediction of wildfire-risk areas?

## Alert and share data about of active fires
Can aggregating and summarizing relevant imagery and data about active fires enable more efficient fire management and decision-making?


# How do I cite Planet data in my work?
From a concept in our garage, to operating the largest fleet of Earth-imaging satellites, many people have invested time and energy in developing and enabling access to Planetâ€™s unique data feed. Please cite Planet when using our imagery and tools. To cite Planet data in publications, please use the following:
