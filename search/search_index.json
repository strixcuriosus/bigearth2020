Whether you're monitoring forest health, quantifying urban growth, tracking shipping patterns, assessing disaster damage, or modeling fire risk, your data science toolkit probably includes some indexing on both space and time. Planet was founded almost a decade ago and continues to operate with this ambitious mission: to image the whole world every day making change visible, accessible, and actionable. In our current state of sheltering-in-place during the COVID-19 pandemic, we can still observe and analyze our ever-changing world thanks to sensors in space!","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#motivation","text":"You can't fix what you can't see.

It can be used to search Planet's catalog of imagery, view metadata, and download full-resolution images. Search You can search Planet's imagery by date, location, and various metadata filters in Explorer. Let's use NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) to find locations of some recent fires and find relevant Planet imagery in Explorer. Note: the FIRMS map includes coordinates in the url with this pattern c:lon,lat , e.g. this url https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#z:10;c:-121.5,39.7;t:adv-points;d:2018-11-02..2018-11-30;l:firms_viirs contains c:-121.5,39.7 . Planet Explorer's search bar will expect these coordinates in the opposite order (latitude, longitude). Try searching for 39.7,-121.5 in Explorer.

Since the 2020 Big Earth Hacks event is a wildland fire challenge, the examples and demos will focus on fire-related data stories. You need not limit yourself to looking at imagery of active fires, though! Think about how biogeochemical systems and human society inter-relate: what kinds of structural changes can contribute to fire risk? where are the bottlenecks in modern wildfire alerting systems? how can we measure long-term effects of fires on communities and ecosystems?
